# Condition ðŸ”€

Conditional statements let your program make decisions.

### Topics Covered
- **if statement**: Runs code only if a condition is true.
  ```c
  if (x > 0) {
      printf("Positive\n");
  }
<br>

- **if...else**: Runs code only if a condition is true.
  ```c
    if (x % 2 == 0) {
        printf("Even\n");
    } else {
        printf("Odd\n");
    }
<br>

- **else if:**: Runs code only if a condition is true.

<br>

- **switch**: Runs code only if a condition is true.
  ```c
    switch(day) {
        case 1: printf("Monday"); break;
        case 2: printf("Tuesday"); break;
        default: printf("Other day");
    }
<br>

- **Comparison Operators**: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`

- **Logical Operators**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

### Why It Matters
Without conditions, programs would only execute linearly. Conditions let your code react dynamically to data and user input.
