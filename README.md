# <center>Intructions for Repository<center>

You can follow my progress and try out some fun and challenging exercises along the way. Feel free to explore the code files and check the README.md in each folder to better understand the concepts and how C works. ✔️

## How to clone and run ⚙️
Using bash you will do the following instructions:<br>

- 1° Inside bash paste (to clone the repository):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EduardoCansan/learning-C.git
```

- 2° Now open the project in a IDE of your preference, in my case `Vscode`

- 3° To explore the codes you can enter the folders and check one of your preference:

```bash
cd 1.Introduction
```

- 4° This is how you create execute program in C, to run C files:

```bash
gcc 1.helloWorld.c -o 1.helloWorld.exe
```

- 5° Now to tun this file you use:

```bash
./1.helloWorld.exe
```
