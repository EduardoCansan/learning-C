# Introduction 🌐

This section introduces you to the basics of the C programming language.

### Topics Covered
- **History of C**: Created in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, C is widely used for system software, embedded systems, and as a foundation for many modern languages.

<br>

- **Structure of a C Program**:
  - `#include <stdio.h>` → allows input/output functions like `printf`.
  - `int main()` → the entry point of every program.
  - `printf()` → function to print text to the screen.
  - `return 0;` → ends the program successfully.

<br>

- **Different types of variables**:
  - `int` → stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.
  - `float` → stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.
  - `char` → stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes.

<br>

- **Using Scanf**:
  - `%d` → reads a decimal integer (`int`)
  - `%f` → reads a floating-point number (`float`)
  - `%c` → reads a single character (`char`)

<br>


- **Semicolons and Braces**: Every statement ends with `;`, and code blocks are wrapped in `{ }`.

- **Comments**: Use `//` for single-line and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments.

### Why It Matters
This is the foundation: once you understand how a C program is structured, you can build anything on top of it.
